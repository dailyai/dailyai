## About

[Daily AI Archive](https://dailyai.github.io/) is a personal blog run by Byung-Hoon Kim. This blog was started in March 2021 to summarize, archive and share my daily skim of AI papers published on arXiv that day. I usually go through papers uploaded to the sections:

- Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,
- Computation and Language,
- Machine Learning,

and sometimes

- Social and Information Networks,
- Artificial Intelligence.

The selection of papers to be archived is solely based on my academic interest.
